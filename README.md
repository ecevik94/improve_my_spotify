# improve_my_spotify
This repo has two purposes: reordering songs in my spotify playlists and improving my spotify 2024 results.

# Why am I working on my playlists?
Even though I love creating playlist, I always struggle with ordering the songs that I choose and at some point, I satrt adding random songs and loose the meaning of the playlist. 

# Why am I working with my 2024?
Let's be honest, it was a disappointment because it was lack of human creativity. 

# Step 1
You need to have a Spotify Developer account 
- Then, create an app to reach your Client ID and Client Secret. 
- Of course I can't share them with you :) 
- I created two python files client_id and client_secret that includes these variables. Later I will use them as a secret variable.
